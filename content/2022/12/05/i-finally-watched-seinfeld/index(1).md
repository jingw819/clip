Of all the pop-culture phenomena that I have managed to miss out on in my life—and there have been many—no lapse might be greater than having never watched a single episode of “Seinfeld.” In the final decade of the twentieth century, this was no small feat, and it was accomplished, in part, because I didn’t own a television set—only high art for me—but mostly because I harbored a long-simmering antagonism toward mainstream America, with the notable exception of professional sports. It would have been impossible, of course, for me to ever fully outrun the wide reach of the show, as it was being referred to by everyone everywhere, with catchphrases quoted, yada yada, etc., and scenes described, and jokes retold. Often, I would find myself on the periphery of a group of friends or co-workers, perennial outsider that I was, waiting for the laughter to subside, as they discussed what had been said or done the night before by Jerry or whomever; if I had been a bit more liberated, I perhaps could have admitted that the scenarios did seem somewhat funny in the recounting.

在我一生中设法错过的所有流行文化现象中——有很多——没有比从未看过一集《宋飞正传》更大的失误了。 在 20 世纪的最后十年，这是一项不小的壮举，它的实现部分是因为我没有电视机——对我来说只有高雅的艺术——但主要是因为我对美国主流，职业运动除外。 当然，我不可能完全超越这部剧的广泛影响力，因为它被世界各地的每个人引用，引用标语、yada yada 等，描述场景，重述笑话。 通常，我会发现自己处于一群朋友或同事的边缘，我是常年的局外人，等待笑声平息，因为他们讨论了杰瑞或其他人前一天晚上所说或所做的事情； 如果我再放开一点，我也许会承认，这些场景在叙述中确实显得有些滑稽。

But, even when the show finally ended, there was no discernible abating of its cultural impact in syndication, and the years continued to pass with catchphrases still quoted, scenes still described, and me still standing on the sideline completely clueless. Until one day, two decades later, I decided that I would take matters into my own hands: I would watch the show once and for all, _every_ episode of the show, from start to finish, one episode a day, and that meant, for the record, a hundred and eighty days of “Seinfeld.” This was pre-[pandemic](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/coronavirus), when such an undertaking would have been seen, at least by me, as an indulgent waste of time, but I justified it as a form of self-improvement. It also conveniently gave me something to occupy myself with during my lunch break in the basement of the N.Y.U. library where I would go every day to write, sitting in a cubicle amid college students who had been born after “Seinfeld” but probably knew more about it than I did.

但是，即使节目最终结束，它在联合组织中的文化影响也没有明显减弱，岁月继续流逝，仍然引用标语，描述场景，而我仍然站在场边完全无能为力。 直到二十年后的一天，我决定自己动手：我会一劳永逸地观看节目， _节目的每一_ 集，从头到尾，每天一集，这意味着，作为记录，一百八十天的“宋飞正传”。 那是在 [大流行](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/coronavirus) 之前，至少在我看来，这样的工作会被视为一种放纵的浪费时间，但我认为这是一种自我完善的方式。 它也方便地让我在纽约大学图书馆地下室的午休时间有一些事情可以打发时间它比我做的。

And so I began to watch, circa twelve o’clock on an October afternoon, nearly thirty years after the fact, Season 1, Episode 1, eating my sandwich, while Jerry, as his standup-comedic persona, opened the series with a set about the universal need that people have to “go out,” and then, once “out,” the need to “get back.” “Do you know what this is all about?” he asked of the delighted audience. “Why we’re here? To be _out_.” This was followed a few minutes later by a scene in a laundromat with Jerry trying to convince an increasingly frustrated George that there was a misconception about clothes being “overdry.” “You can’t ‘overdry,’ ” Jerry explains, “the same reason you can’t ‘overwet.’ ” This was the entire essence of the show in the first ten minutes: the wordplay, the observational humor, the low stakes—and, through the wonders of societal osmosis, much of it was already completely familiar, including the theme music.

所以我开始看，大约在 10 月的一个下午 12 点钟，也就是事隔将近 30 年后，第 1 季第 1 集吃着我的三明治，而杰里作为他的单口喜剧角色，以一组关于人们必须“走出去”，然后一旦“走出去”，又需要“回来”的普遍需求。 “你知道这是怎么回事吗？” 他问高兴的听众。 “我们为什么在这里？ 要 _出去了_ 。 几分钟后，在一家自助洗衣店里发生了一个场景，杰里试图说服越来越沮丧的乔治，让他相信人们对衣服“过干”存在误解。 “你不能‘过度干燥’，”杰瑞解释说，“这与你不能‘过度润湿’的原因相同。 ” 这就是前十分钟节目的全部精髓：文字游戏、观察幽默、低风险——而且，通过社会渗透的奇迹，其中大部分内容已经完全熟悉，包括主题音乐。

It was slow going for me in the beginning. I was bored, perplexed, and mostly unamused—this is what all the fuss was about?—trying my best to find purchase among silly story lines and quirky characters. There was Kramer, pulling two slices of bread from his bathrobe pockets, asking Jerry, “You got any meat?” There was George, flustered again, inventing the figure of Art Vandelay, importer-exporter. By the end of the first week, I was finished with Season 1, all five episodes. Then came Season 2, more of the same and twice as long, with Kramer sitting on the couch shovelling cantaloupe into his mouth, George trying to break up with his girlfriend, and Jerry doing a set about the indignity of waiting rooms. It occurred to me, in my humorless state, that the extreme compression was working against my enjoyment, that the show would have been better with slower digestion, one episode per week as intended, followed the next day by recapping at the water cooler, and then summers off. Instead, I was alone and swallowing “Seinfeld” whole. It was also possible that I was trying, albeit unconsciously, to justify a decision I had made thirty years ago, and that each solitary laugh now threatened to cause a painful fissure in my world view. In other words, I was caught somewhere between comedy and regret. At the rate I was watching, it was going to take me six months to complete the entire DVD boxed set, thirty-three discs, heavy like a brick, which I had to return to the seventh floor of the library every seven days—taking the stairs for exercise—so that I could ask to check it out for yet one more week.

一开始对我来说进展缓慢。 我很无聊，很困惑，而且大部分时间都不觉得好笑——这就是所有大惊小怪的原因吗？——尽我最大的努力在愚蠢的故事情节和古怪的角色中寻找购买点。 克莱默从浴袍口袋里掏出两片面包，问杰瑞：“你有肉吗？” 乔治再次慌张，编造了阿特·范德莱这个进口商兼出口商的形象。 到第一周结束时，我完成了第一季的所有五集。 然后是第 2 季，更多内容相同且时长加倍，克莱默坐在沙发上将哈密瓜塞进嘴里，乔治试图与女友分手，而杰瑞则拍摄了一组关于候诊室的侮辱。 我突然想到，在我毫无幽默感的状态下，极度的压缩对我的享受不利，如果消化速度慢一些，节目会更好，按计划每周一集，第二天在饮水机旁重温，和然后夏天休息。 相反，我独自一人，整个吞下了《宋飞正传》。 也有可能我在试图，尽管是无意识地，为我三十年前做出的决定辩护，而现在每一个孤独的笑声都可能在我的世界观中造成痛苦的裂痕。 换句话说，我介于喜剧和遗憾之间。 按照我看的速度，我要花六个月的时间才能完成整套 DVD 盒装，三十三张光盘，重得像块砖头，我必须每七天把它们送回图书馆七楼——带着锻炼的楼梯——这样我就可以要求再检查一周。

What I had not been able to anticipate was the very palpable sensation of being transported back to a younger version of myself, dropped straight into the nineteen-nineties, and then slowly moving forward in time, episode by episode, through an era exemplified by the show’s hair styles, the outfits, and, perhaps most of all, the enormous Mac computer in the background on Jerry’s desk. It was an era that was also exemplified by the first Gulf War, which had, incidentally, preëmpted the start of the second season by one week. I had been in my early twenties then, working as a short-order cook at a restaurant in Pittsburgh, making five dollars an hour, and spending my shift, when I wasn’t grilling hamburgers, sitting on an upturned milk crate as I sliced hundreds of pounds of potatoes for French fries. This was not my dream job—I wanted to be an actor—and I was unhappy and sullen and not the best short-order cook. And then the war began, and this only exacerbated my unhappiness, as well as my anger and isolation, surrounded as I was by co-workers, not to mention everyone else in the country, who seemed, without exception, to champion the war. A week or so after the U.S. invasion, I violated one of the central precepts of the workplace and got into an ill-advised political discussion with the chef. He was pro-war, and he was also my boss, and I recall that we both, at first, tried our best to be reasoned and measured, or at least to have the _affect_ of being reasoned and measured, but that the exchange soon devolved into condescension, passive-aggressiveness, and, finally, voices raised. And, a few days after that, I came into the restaurant one morning to find that my name wasn’t listed on the following week’s schedule, which, in the hospitality business, is code for _You’re fired_. Why I had been fired, I didn’t know. Nor could anyone give me a good reason, including the chef. In lieu of a good reason, I came up with my own: I had been fired for being of Middle Eastern descent. This is what I mean when I say that I harbored a long-simmering antagonism toward mainstream America.

我没能预料到的是一种非常明显的感觉，那就是我被传送回了我年轻时的版本，直接掉进了 19 世纪 90 年代，然后慢慢地向前移动，一集一集，通过一个以秀的发型、服装，也许最重要的是杰瑞办公桌背景中巨大的 Mac 电脑。 那个时代也以第一次海湾战争为例，顺便说一下，这场战争比第二季的开始提前了一周。 那时我二十出头，在匹兹堡的一家餐馆做快餐厨师，每小时赚五美元，轮班时我不烤汉堡，坐在一个倒过来的牛奶箱上切数百磅土豆炸薯条。 这不是我梦寐以求的工作——我想成为一名演员——我很不开心、闷闷不乐，也不是最好的快餐厨师。 然后战争开始了，这只会加剧我的不快，以及我的愤怒和孤立，因为我周围都是同事，更不用说这个国家的其他人了，他们似乎无一例外地支持这场战争。 美国入侵一周左右后，我违反了工作场所的核心戒律之一，与厨师进行了不明智的政治讨论。 他支持战争，他也是我的老板，我记得我们俩，一开始，都尽力做到讲道理和分寸，或者至少让 _被推理和衡量的影响_ ，但交流很快就变成了居高临下，被动攻击，最后，声音提高了。 几天后，有一天早上我走进餐厅，发现我的名字没有出现在下周的日程表上，而在酒店业，下周的日程表是“ _你被解雇了”_ 的代号。 为什么我被解雇了，我不知道。 也没有人能给我一个充分的理由，包括厨师。 代替一个很好的理由，我想出了自己的理由：我因为是中东血统而被解雇了。 当我说我对美国主流怀有长期酝酿的敌意时，这就是我的意思。

So I was undergoing a sort of parallel viewing experience, with one version of myself sitting in the N.Y.U. library watching the show in the present, and a second version—whether I wanted it to or not—reliving my distant past. As the actors aged, so did I, my youth passing along with the series at an accelerated rate. By the time I had reached Season 5, I was twenty-four years old, just like that, living in [New York City](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/new-york-city) while Jerry stood onstage ruminating on the invention of seedless watermelons (“I guess if they can get rid of the seeds, the rind is going next”) and Kramer burst through the front door, as per usual, carrying an air-conditioner (“Twelve thousand B.T.U.s of raw cooling power!”)—and I was renting an illegal sublet on the Upper East Side, filled with optimism about my acting career, sending my head shot out to hundreds of casting agents, and then waiting for the phone to ring. I was aware of a subtle but significant shift taking place in my psyche, in which the characters had become familiar to me, almost, dare I say, like friends, and I could begin to understand the internal logic of their behavior. If I wasn’t completely amused, I was, at least, _affectionate_.

It also happened to be around this time that I did the thing that everyone always did with “Seinfeld”: I made a connection between a real-world event and a specific episode of the show. Up to now, I’d always been the straight-faced bystander, of course, listening as someone explained, through their laughter, “That’s just like when Elaine did X. . . .” But, one afternoon, while a friend told me the story of a date gone wrong, I suddenly recalled, without any prompting, the remarkably applicable episode in which George, enamored with a woman, is invited up to her apartment to have coffee. “Oh, no, thanks,” he tells her, blithely unaware of the subtext of her overture. “I can’t drink coffee late at night. It keeps me up.” It’s only after she’s gone that he realizes his folly and that he has missed out on a clear opportunity for romance. I had scarcely begun describing the episode to my friend when he cut me off. “I can’t drink coffee late at night,” he said, quoting George to me. He knew the episode. He knew the episode better than I knew the episode. I’d seen it recently, but he’d seen it many times, every episode many times, often when they aired in prime time, and later in syndication, and they were burned into his brain. A moment later, he was pulling the scene up on YouTube, and sitting there beside him I could see the humor of the situation, the _human condition_ of it, the constant travails of poor George, always striving, never achieving. We watched together, my friend and I, both of us chuckling along, but only he had the glow of nostalgia.

也正是在这个时候，我做了每个人在《宋飞正传》中总是做的事情：我在现实世界的事件和节目的特定剧集之间建立了联系。 到现在为止，我一直是板着脸的旁观者，当然，听着有人解释说，通过他们的笑声，“这就像伊莱恩做 X.. . ” 但是，一天下午，当一位朋友告诉我约会出错的故事时，我突然想起了一个非常适用的情节，其中乔治迷恋一个女人，被邀请到她的公寓喝咖啡。 “哦，不，谢谢，”他告诉她，没有意识到她提议的潜台词。 “我不能在深夜喝咖啡。 它让我振作起来。” 直到她离开后，他才意识到自己的愚蠢，他错过了一个明显的浪漫机会。 当他打断我时，我几乎没有开始向我的朋友描述这一集。 “我不能在深夜喝咖啡，”他引用乔治的话对我说。 他知道那一集。 他比我更了解这一集。 我最近看过它，但他看过很多次，每一集都看过很多次，经常是在黄金时段播出，后来在联合播出时，它们被烙进了他的脑海。 片刻之后，他在 YouTube 上播放了这一幕，坐在他身边的我可以看到当时的情景， _它的人类状况_ ，可怜的乔治不断的艰辛，总是在努力，却从未取得成就。 我们一起观看，我和我的朋友，我们俩一起咯咯地笑着，但只有他有怀旧的光芒。
