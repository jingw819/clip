This time, once again, Taylor does not get a record deal, but RCA offers her a development deal, which is not a record deal, obviously. It's like, hey, we're going to invest resources in you and make a record that we're then going to release. We'll get it on radio and see how you do. A development deal is like we think you have potential, we're not ready to commit to a full record. It's like a small check from a venture firm. We’ll participate in the round, we're not going to lead it though.

这一次，泰勒再一次没有获得唱片合约，但 RCA 为她提供了一份发展合约，这显然不是唱片合约。 就像，嘿，我们将在你身上投入资源并制作一张我们将要发布的唱片。 我们会在广播中得到它，看看你怎么做。 开发交易就像我们认为您有潜力一样，我们还没有准备好提交完整的记录。 这就像来自风险投资公司的小额支票。 我们将参与该回合，但我们不会领导它。
